# Attrition-Predictor-Model
This is an Attrition prediction model which uses the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition &amp; Performance dataset.
The main model file is the IBM.ipynb and the visuals folder contains the images of code outputs. Running the notebook file will also generate those images again.
The standard libraries like sklearn, imblearn, seaborn, matplotlib, etc are required to run this file.
I have also included a Report pdf which summarises and walks through the process.
